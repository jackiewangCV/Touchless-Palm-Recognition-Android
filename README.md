# Touchless-Palm-Recognition-Android

## Overview

Touchless `palmprint` recognition is a biometric technology which provides effective and reliable personal identification in `eKYC` or digital onboarding process.</br>
This repo implemented `palm print` reocgnition on `Android` native platform by applying `hand landmarking`, `edge detection`, `2D-Gabor filter` and `feature extraction` approaches. we have `palm vein` recognition model trained, as well.</br>
This project consists of 2 kinds of part: `ROI` extraction and plam feature matching algorithm.</br>
> This repository demonstrates both `palm print` `ROI` extraction and `palm print` feature matching technology into `Android` native platform.</br>

I have palmprint and palmvein model(available in python & C++) pre-built and ready to customize or improve things according to the requirements.</br>
